# Raylib.jl
Raylib 5.0 wrapper for julia
Binary is built for 4.3 OpenGL
Wrapper is created using [Clang.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Clang.jl)
TO-DO: build from source, maybe move artifact to yggdrasil, but there is a problem with different subversions of the lib with the same version (e.g. raylib can be built with different switchable features and graphic API's)
